# Script Written by Drew Burgess 12/19/2021

Remotely Check For RPCSS Protocol PowerShell [3.0.0]
This script can be either ran in ISE or Console.
Feel free to take this simple code, I just needed it for a bigger project I am working on.
Some computers recently imaged with Windows 10 20H2 seem to have this service off on initial setup.
I wasn't able to get the service to start after multiple reboots so I made this script.
